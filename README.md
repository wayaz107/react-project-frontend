SkinCare Products

This project was built with a Rails API and a React/Redux frontend. Users can add products with a name, and brand name. You can add comments to those products as well as add products to your wish-list.

To Run The App

With the rails server running (rails s), you can 'cd react-project-frontend' and run 'npm start'. That will take you to https://localhost:3000 or ttps://localhost:3001 if the rails server is running on port 3000.

How To Use

You will be on the home page.
To see all of your products, click 'Products'. There, you can add a new product or click on an existing product to add comments to it. Here, you can also add a product to your personal collection list or to a wish list.
Click 'Personal Collection' to see the products you already own.
Click 'Wish List' to see which products you want to buy.
